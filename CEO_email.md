**Subject: [Retail Company] Performance Analysis**<br><br>
Hello,<br>

I hope you're doing well! Below are a few summary statistics and potential drivers of success for our porfolio retail company. Please let me know if you have any questions.<br>

*Profit Margin Data*<br>
Mean: 24.86%<br>
Median: 26.18%<br>
The distribution of annual profit margins by location is slightly skewed to the left as shown [here](https://github.com/saahilshangle/ds-retail-analysis/blob/master/media/annual_profit_margin_distn.png). This indicates that relatively fewer stores are experiencing lower margins on average. [Monthly](https://github.com/saahilshangle/ds-retail-analysis/blob/master/media/monthly_agg_revenue.png) and [quarterly](https://github.com/saahilshangle/ds-retail-analysis/blob/master/media/quarterly_agg_revenue.png) aggregate revenue linked for your reference as well.<br>

*Potential Drivers of Success*<br>
After identifying outperforming retail locations and evaluating their features, a few potential indicators stood out. 50% of the top 30 locations were from Texas. Furthermore, top locations demonstrated higher revenue or lower fixed/variable costs. Additional operational information is needed to determine what changes may lead to an increase in profits.<br>

Hope this helps and happy to clarify and/or look more closely elsewhere as well.<br>

Best,<br>
Saahil Shangle
