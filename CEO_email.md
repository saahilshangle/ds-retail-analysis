**Subject: [Retail Company] Performance Analysis**<br>
Hello,<br>

I hope you're doing well! Below are a few summary statistics and potential drivers of success for our porfolio retail company. Please let me know if you have any questions.<br>

*Profit Margin Data*<br>
Mean: 24.86%<br>
Median: 26.18%<br>
The distribution of annual profit margins by location is slightly skewed to the left as shown [here](www.example.com). This indicates that relatively fewer stores are experiencing lower margins on average, which is positive.<br>

*Potential Drivers of Success*<br>
After identifying outperforming retail locations and evaluating their features, a few potential reasons for success stood out. Top locations demonstrated either or a combination of significantly higher revenue and lower fixed/variable costs. Additional information may be able to point a clearer picture as to how certain stores were able to adjust these facets.<br>

Hope this helps and happy to clarify/dig deeper elsewhere as well.<br>

Best,
Saahil Shangle
